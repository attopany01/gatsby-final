# How to Send Bitcoin Using Coinbase: A Step-by-Step Guide

Sending Bitcoin is easy once you understand the process. Whether you’re transferring Bitcoin to another wallet or paying for goods or services, Coinbase provides a user-friendly platform to handle your transactions. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to send Bitcoin using Coinbase.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Coinbase Account

Before you can send Bitcoin, you need to have a Coinbase account. Here’s how to set one up:

1. **Sign Up**: Visit the [Coinbase website](https://www.coinbase.com) and click on “Get Started.”
2. **Verify Your Identity**: Coinbase will ask you to provide some personal information to verify your identity.
3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: For added security, enable 2FA to protect your account.

## Step 2: Add Bitcoin to Your Coinbase Wallet

Once your account is set up, you’ll need to add Bitcoin to your Coinbase wallet. If you don’t have Bitcoin yet, you can purchase it directly on Coinbase. Here's how:

1. **Go to the Buy/Sell Section**: Navigate to the "Buy/Sell" tab on your dashboard.
2. **Select Bitcoin (BTC)**: Choose Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency you want to purchase.
3. **Add Payment Method**: You can add a payment method such as a bank account, debit/credit card, or PayPal.
4. **Complete Your Purchase**: Enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy, review the fees, and confirm your purchase.

After completing your purchase, your Bitcoin will be available in your Coinbase wallet.

## Step 3: Navigate to the Send/Receive Section

To send Bitcoin, follow these steps:

1. **Open Coinbase**: Log into your Coinbase account.
2. **Go to 'Send/Receive'**: On the main dashboard, click on the "Send/Receive" button at the top right of the screen.

## Step 4: Send Bitcoin to Another Wallet

Now that you are in the "Send/Receive" section, follow these steps to send Bitcoin:

1. **Choose 'Send'**: Under the "Send" tab, select Bitcoin (BTC) from the drop-down menu.
2. **Enter the Recipient's Bitcoin Address**: You’ll need the recipient's Bitcoin wallet address. This is a long string of alphanumeric characters. If you’re sending Bitcoin to another Coinbase user, you can select them from your contact list.
3. **Enter the Amount to Send**: You can either enter the amount of Bitcoin in BTC or the equivalent in your local currency (USD, EUR, etc.).
4. **Choose Transaction Fee**: Coinbase gives you the option to select a transaction fee. The higher the fee, the faster your transaction will be confirmed. Coinbase typically offers a standard fee or you can choose a custom fee.
5. **Review Transaction Details**: Double-check the recipient’s address and the amount you’re sending.
6. **Click 'Send'**: Once everything looks good, click “Send” to confirm the transaction.

## Step 5: Confirm the Transaction

Coinbase will ask you to confirm the transaction via email or SMS. After you confirm, your Bitcoin will be sent, and you’ll receive a notification that the transaction is being processed.
