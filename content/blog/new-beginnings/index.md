## How Long Does It Take for Bitcoin to Send?

Bitcoin transactions are processed by miners who validate them and add them to the blockchain. The time it takes for a Bitcoin transaction to be confirmed depends on the network's congestion and the transaction fee you selected.

- **Low Fee**: It could take several hours.
- **High Fee**: The transaction will likely be processed within a few minutes.

## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

Here are some common problems and how to address them:

- **Transaction Delayed**: If your transaction is taking longer than expected, it could be due to a low transaction fee. You can try increasing the fee if it's still pending.
- **Wrong Address**: Always double-check the recipient’s address. Transactions are irreversible, so if you send Bitcoin to the wrong address, there’s no way to recover it.
